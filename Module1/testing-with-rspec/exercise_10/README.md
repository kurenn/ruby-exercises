# Calculator

You're building the engine for a calculator app. Your partner has asked you for the following features:

* Add two or more numbers
* Subtract two numbers
* Multiply two or more numbers
* Divide two numbers
* List the factors of a number
* Tell if a number is prime
* List all the primes in a given range

# Usage

Edit `lib/calc.rb` to build your change machine's functionality. We've given you the basic structure of your new change machine.

Then run `rspec` in this directory to see if your change machine meets the spec.

The spec below is encoded into an RSpec test suite in `spec/calc_spec.rb`.

# Spec

Check out `spec/calc_spec.rb` to see the detailed tests for each feature.

## Setup

1. Inside this folder run then bundler command to install all dependencies

```bash
% bundle install
```

2. Run the tests

```bash
% rspec spec
```
