# Sum Class

We are working with the code from the lesson. In this case a class with just one method to sum any number or values sent as arguments.

Your tasks to do are:

* Add more tests examples with `negative` and `decimal` numbers. Two for each is good enough.
* You are now ask to add the other 3 basic aritmetic operations - `-`, `*` and `/`
  * Create one method for each of these, so `sum` instead of `run` for the current implementation
  * You may need to change the current class name to something else, that makes more sense
  * Add at least 3 tests cases for each method, consider `positive` numbers, `negative` and `decimals`
  * In the case of division, add a division by zero case

# Setup
