Loki: I have an army!

Tony Stark: We have a Hulk.

Captain America: There's only one God ma'am, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like "that."

Hulk: That man has a brain full of cats. You can smell crazy on him.

Hawkeye: Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in? Do you know what it's like to be unmade?

Hulk: That's my secret, Captain. I'm always angry.

Tony Stark: I love you 3000

Tony Stark: Cause if we can’t protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we’ll avenge it

Captain America: I can do this all day

Hawkeye: If we’re going to win this fight, some of us might have to lose it

Captain America: You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed… walk it off.

Hawkeye: The city is flying and we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense.

Captain America: Avengers, assemble!

Stan Lee: SUPERHEROES IN NEW YORK? GIMME A BREAK.

Thor: Is that the best you can do?

Black Widow: These guys come from legend, Captain. They're basically Gods.

Captain America: Hail Hydra

Tony Stark: Part of the journey is the end
