# User Image Generator Mocks & Stubs Challenge

**Kudos to TouringSchool on this challenge. - https://github.com/turingschool-examples/user_image_generator**

This repo is meant to be used in conjunction with the [Mocks & Stubs](https://backend.turing.io/module1/lessons/mocks_stubs)
lesson plan.

## Challenge

- Start by running the `image_generator_spec.rb`
- Add a test for `#generate_images` and `#change_max_size` in the corresponding `./lib/image_generator.rb` by stubbing out the randomness that these methods rely on
- Move on to the `user_spec.rb`
- Run the tests, and read through the comments carefully
- Using stubs and/or mocks, write the tests to confirm the rest of the functionality that exists in `./lib/user.rb`
